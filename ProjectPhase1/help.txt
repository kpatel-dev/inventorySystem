Instructions for marker:


SET UP
During the program set-up, make sure to set the ProjectPhase1 directory as the output directory.
Do this by going to file, then to project structure, then to project. At the bottom, set the project
compiler output to ProjectPhase1 and click apply. The sales list, price lists, and daily
sales list will be sent to the same directory as the one that ProjectPhase1 is in. These files can
be accessed here or moved from here to be saved somewhere else.There will also be a Logs directory
inside the ProjectPhase1 directory. All the logs will be stored here according to the date.

FIRST RUN OF PROGRAM
When running the program for the first time, make sure line 21 is uncommented. The initialEvents.txt
file has a line-by-line input that mimics what a real user might type, in the order that the program
asks. It loads the initial inventory from initialInventory.txt, goes through user registration, and
then goes through all of the possible user commands. Throughout this process, some things may be
saved onto .txt files or printed into the console. The input from the initialEvents.txt is not
printed into the console, so it may be a bit difficult to follow. Refer to initialEvents.txt to see
which commands were inputted. Once the program ends, there will be .ser files in the ProjectPhase1
directory.

LOADING SYSTEM FROM .SER FILES
To test the serializable functionality, comment out line 21 and uncomment line 23. The program will
now load the data serialized from the first run of the program. There are a couple of sample lines
where a user registered in the first run of the program logs in again in this run of the program
without having to re-register, showing that the data was successfully serialized and deserialized.

ORDER OUTPUT
Orders are output as text documents, under the OrderList folder that will be created in the main
directory. The user can then choose to copy the contents of the file to "send" out the order. These
files will be automatically deleted when an order comes in and is processed.
